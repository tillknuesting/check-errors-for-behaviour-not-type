# Go Error Inspection: Behavior over Type
This repository provides a Go implementation showcasing the paradigm of error handling based on behavior rather than type. The approach leverages Go's interfaces and type assertions to classify errors not by what they are (type), but by what they can do (behavior). This promotes better abstraction and flexible error handling strategies in your Go applications. Explore the code to understand how you can apply this concept in your Go development.
